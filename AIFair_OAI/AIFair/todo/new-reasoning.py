Based on the search results, several cutting-edge approaches for enhancing LLM reasoning and performance have emerged in recent years. Here are some of the most advanced methods:

## Inference-time Techniques

1. **Retrieval-augmented reflection (RaR)**: This method iteratively revises a chain of thoughts guided by information retrieval, significantly improving LLMs' reasoning abilities across various tasks[1].

2. **MindStar (M*)**: A tree-like search-based reasoning framework that enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities during inference time, showing substantial improvements on datasets like GSM8K and MATH[1].

## Post-training Methods

1. **Process-supervised reward models (PRMs)**: This approach aligns the model's reasoning trajectory alongside intermediate steps, providing a richer and more genuine reasoning path[2].

2. **Iterative Reasoning Preference Optimization (IRPO)**: This method enhances LLMs' performance on reasoning tasks by iteratively optimizing preferences between competing Chain-of-Thought candidates[2].

## Search and Planning

1. **AutoToS (Automated Thought of Search)**: This algorithm enhances the planning abilities of LLMs while reducing costs. It uses LLMs to propose search algorithms that can be plugged into classic search mechanisms, achieving 100% accuracy with very few calls to the LLM[3].

## Agentic Workflows and Tool Use

1. **Function Calling**: This technique enables structured communication between LLMs and external APIs, improving automation and reducing human dependence[4].

2. **LlamaIndex Workflow**: This framework constructs a function-calling agent from scratch, allowing for stateful interactions with memory and the ability to call LLMs to select tools and process incoming user messages[4].

## Code Generation and Verification

1. **Dafny as Verification-Aware Intermediate Language**: This approach uses formal methods to increase the quality of code generated by LLMs, generating an intermediate representation in Dafny that can be automatically validated for correctness[5].

These approaches represent some of the most advanced techniques in improving LLM reasoning, planning, and code generation capabilities. They demonstrate significant progress in areas such as inference-time reasoning, post-training optimization, and integration with classical search algorithms and formal verification methods.
