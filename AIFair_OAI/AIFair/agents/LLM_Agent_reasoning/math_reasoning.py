# Core technologies you'll need
# - Python
# - PyTorch or TensorFlow
# - Hugging Face Transformers
# - Basic LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic)
# - Vector databases (optional, for storing reasoning steps)

Step 1: Dataset Creation
# Example structure for reasoning problems
problems = {
    "id": "math_001",
    "question": "Solve this step by step: If a train travels 120 km in 2 hours, what is its speed?",
    "type": "mathematical",
    "difficulty": "easy",
    "solution_steps": ["Identify known values", "Use speed formula", "Calculate final answer"],
    "correct_answer": "60 kilometers per hour"
}


# Basic setup with multiple models
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import openai

class ReasoningArena:
    def __init__(self):
        # Local model
        self.model1 = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")
        # API model
        self.model2 = openai.OpenAI()  # OpenAI client
        
    def get_responses(self, problem):
        # Get responses from both models
        response1 = self.get_local_model_response(problem)
        response2 = self.get_api_model_response(problem)
        return [response1, response2]
# evaluation 
class ReasoningJudge:
    def evaluate_response(self, response, problem):
        # Score different aspects
        reasoning_score = self.evaluate_reasoning_steps(response)
        accuracy_score = self.check_answer_accuracy(response, problem)
        clarity_score = self.assess_clarity(response)
        
        return {
            "reasoning": reasoning_score,
            "accuracy": accuracy_score,
            "clarity": clarity_score,
            "total": (reasoning_score + accuracy_score + clarity_score) / 3
