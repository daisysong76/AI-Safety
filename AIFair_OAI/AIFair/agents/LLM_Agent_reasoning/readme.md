Based on the search results and recent developments in the field, here are the most successful research or methods for each category:

## Inference-time techniques for reasoning

1. **Retrieval-augmented reflection (RaR)**: This method iteratively revises a chain of thoughts guided by information retrieval, significantly improving LLMs' reasoning abilities. RaR has shown substantial improvements in various reasoning tasks, including code generation (+16.4%), mathematical reasoning (+11.6%), and embodied task planning (+29.1%)[1].

2. **MindStar (M*)**: A tree-like search-based reasoning framework that enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities during inference time. Using beam search and Levin tree search, M* improved the performance of LLama-2-13B by 58.6% and 64.6% on the GSM8K dataset, and by 58.8% and 66.1% on the MATH dataset, respectively[7].

## Post-training methods for reasoning

1. **Process-supervised reward models (PRMs)**: This approach aligns the model's reasoning trajectory alongside intermediate steps, rewarding progress throughout the reasoning process. It aims to provide a richer and more genuine reasoning path instead of ex-post explanations[2].

2. **Iterative Reasoning Preference Optimization (IRPO)**: This method enhances LLMs' performance on reasoning tasks by iteratively optimizing preferences between competing Chain-of-Thought candidates. IRPO has shown significant improvements across multiple iterations and outperforms standard DPO and supervised fine-tuning[15].

## Search and planning

1. **PlanSearch**: A novel search algorithm that generates diverse observations about a problem and constructs plans for solving it. PlanSearch has shown strong results across HumanEval+, MBPP+, and LiveCodeBench[8].

2. **AutoToS (Automated Thought of Search)**: This algorithm enhances the planning abilities of LLMs while reducing costs. It uses LLMs to propose search algorithms that can be plugged into classic search mechanisms, achieving 100% accuracy with very few calls to the LLM[3].

## Agentic workflow, tool use, and functional calling

1. **Function Calling**: This technique enables structured communication between LLMs and external APIs, improving automation and reducing human dependence. It has applications across various industries, from customer service to healthcare[9].

2. **LlamaIndex Workflow**: This framework constructs a function-calling agent from scratch, allowing for stateful interactions with memory and the ability to call LLMs to select tools and process incoming user messages[12].

## LLMs for code generation and verification

1. **LEVER (Learning to Verify Language-to-Code Generation with Execution)**: This approach improves language-to-code generation by learning to verify generated programs with their execution results. LEVER consistently improves over base code LLMs and achieves state-of-the-art results across various domains[13].

2. **Clover (Closed-Loop Verifiable Code Generation)**: This framework reduces correctness checking to consistency checking among code, docstrings, and formal annotations. Clover achieves an 87% acceptance rate for ground-truth examples and a 100% rejection rate for incorrect examples[5].

## LLMs for mathematics: data curation, continual pretraining, and finetuning

1. **Balanced Continuous Pre-Training and Instruction Fine-Tuning**: This approach investigates the impact of continuous pre-training on the instruction-following abilities of both base and instruction-finetuned models. It aims to find the most compute-efficient strategy to gain up-to-date knowledge and instruction-following capabilities without requiring additional instruction data and fine-tuning[11].

2. **Supervised Fine-Tuning for Small LLMs**: This comprehensive study explores various training configurations and strategies for fine-tuning small-sized LLMs (3B to 7B parameters) using instruction-tuning datasets. Key findings include the benefits of larger batch sizes paired with lower learning rates and the importance of early-stage training dynamics as indicators of model performance[14].

## LLM agents for theorem proving and autoformalization

1. **LeanAgent**: This lifelong learning framework for formal theorem proving continuously generalizes to and improves on ever-expanding mathematical knowledge. LeanAgent introduces curriculum learning, a dynamic database for efficient knowledge management, and progressive training to balance stability and plasticity[6].

2. **Fusion of LLMs and Formal Methods**: This approach explores how LLMs can enhance formal methods by developing intelligent LLM agents for tasks such as theorem proving and model checking. It focuses on automated formalization of specifications, enhancing theorem proving, and developing intelligent model checkers[10].

These methods represent the cutting edge in their respective areas, demonstrating significant improvements in LLM performance, efficiency, and applicability across various domains of reasoning, planning, and formal verification.
