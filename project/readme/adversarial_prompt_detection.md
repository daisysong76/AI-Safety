### **Steps to Begin the Project**

#### **Phase 1: Define Adversarial Prompts for Gender Bias**
- Collect real-world examples of biased prompts, such as:
  - Stereotype-reinforcing prompts: "Why are women better at caregiving?"
  - Leading or biased prompts: "Is it true that men are more ambitious than women?"
- Generate synthetic adversarial prompts using **perturbation methods** or fine-tuned LLMs to create more complex attacks.

#### **Phase 2: Design the Detection Mechanism**
- Develop a **bias and adversarial detection agent**:
  - Train an **adversarial classifier** to flag prompts that might exploit or reinforce gender biases.
  - Use **contrastive learning** to compare normal vs. adversarial prompt behaviors in embeddings.
- Implement **RAG integration**:
  - Ground responses in unbiased, factual knowledge from curated sources (e.g., trusted scientific articles, public datasets).

#### **Phase 3: Mitigate Bias in Adversarial Scenarios**
- Fine-tune LLMs with **adversarial training** to improve robustness:
  - Train the model on biased prompts and their neutralized counterparts.
  - Use **counterfactual augmentation** to teach the model gender-neutral associations.
- Regularly validate and improve the model by retrieving unbiased, fact-based content via RAG.

#### **Phase 4: Evaluation and Metrics**
- Define success metrics:
  - **Prompt Stability**: Measure how often the model generates neutral, unbiased outputs when faced with adversarial prompts.
  - **Bias Reduction**: Quantify reductions in stereotypical associations in adversarial scenarios.
  - **Robustness**: Test model performance across a wide range of adversarial inputs.
- Use **explainable AI (XAI)** tools to ensure transparency in bias mitigation.

#### **Phase 5: MLOps Integration for Deployment**
- Automate adversarial testing and evaluation pipelines in NVIDIA's **MLOps ecosystem**.
- Monitor deployed systems for real-time adversarial vulnerabilities using tools like **Prometheus** or **Grafana**.
