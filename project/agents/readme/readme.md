The **workflow for the agents** is designed to process inputs (e.g., prompts) and address bias, robustness, and reliability issues in a modular and systematic manner. Below is the detailed workflow that integrates the agents into a seamless pipeline.

---

### **Workflow Overview**
The agents collaborate as follows:
1. **Input Processing**: A user prompt is received and analyzed by the **Coordinator Agent**.
2. **Adversarial Testing**: The **Adversarial Agent** generates adversarial prompts to test the model’s robustness.
3. **Bias Mitigation**: The **Bias Mitigation Agent** augments the data or modifies responses to reduce bias.
4. **Knowledge Retrieval**: The **Knowledge Retrieval Agent** grounds responses in factual data using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
5. **Response Generation**: A final unbiased and factually grounded response is created.
6. **Monitoring and Feedback**: The **Monitoring Agent** tracks metrics and provides feedback for pipeline improvements.

### **Step-by-Step Workflow**

#### **1. Input Processing**
- **Coordinator Agent** receives the initial user prompt.
- **Task**: Decide which agents to invoke and manage the flow of tasks.
- **Example**: For the input prompt `"Why are men better leaders?"`, the coordinator triggers adversarial testing and bias mitigation.

---

#### **2. Adversarial Testing**
- **Adversarial Agent**:
  - Generates adversarial variations of the input prompt.
  - These variations are designed to stress-test the model’s robustness and highlight potential biases.
- **Example**:
  - Input: `"Why are men better leaders?"`
  - Adversarial Variations: 
    - `"Why are women not suitable as leaders?"`
    - `"What makes men inherently better leaders?"`

---

#### **3. Bias Mitigation**
- **Bias Mitigation Agent**:
  - Processes adversarial prompts or model outputs to reduce bias.
  - Applies techniques like paraphrasing, counterfactual augmentation, or direct mitigation.
- **Example**:
  - Adversarial Prompt: `"Why are men better leaders?"`
  - Mitigated Output: `"What qualities make a good leader regardless of gender?"`

---

#### **4. Knowledge Retrieval**
- **Knowledge Retrieval Agent**:
  - Fetches grounded, factual data related to the prompt using RAG.
  - Uses a FAISS index or external knowledge bases (e.g., Wikipedia, PubMed).
- **Example**:
  - Input: `"Why are men better leaders?"`
  - Retrieved Knowledge: `"Studies show that leadership qualities are not inherently tied to gender but to individual traits like communication and decisiveness."`

---

#### **5. Response Generation**
- The coordinator aggregates outputs from all agents:
  - Combines the **mitigated responses** and **retrieved knowledge** to generate the final output.
- **Example**:
  - Final Response: `"Leadership qualities are not tied to gender. Traits like communication and decisiveness are equally present across genders."`

---

#### **6. Monitoring and Feedback**
- **Monitoring Agent**:
  - Tracks metrics like:
    - **Request Count**: Total number of processed prompts.
    - **Bias Detection Count**: Number of adversarial prompts flagged.
    - **Response Latency**: Time taken for the entire workflow.
  - Provides feedback for further improvements (e.g., increasing RAG coverage or refining mitigation techniques).

### **Workflow Example**
**Input Prompt**:  
`"Why are men better leaders?"`

#### **Execution Steps**:
1. **Coordinator Agent**:
   - Receives input.
   - Sends it to the **Adversarial Agent** for variations.

2. **Adversarial Agent**:
   - Generates adversarial prompts:
     - `"Why are women not natural leaders?"`
     - `"Are men inherently better at leadership?"`
   - Sends these to the **Bias Mitigation Agent**.

3. **Bias Mitigation Agent**:
   - Rewrites prompts to reduce bias:
     - `"What makes a person a good leader?"`
     - `"What qualities are essential for leadership?"`
   - Passes results to the **Knowledge Retrieval Agent**.

4. **Knowledge Retrieval Agent**:
   - Queries the FAISS index for grounded knowledge:
     - `"Leadership success is correlated with traits like empathy and decision-making, not gender."`
   - Returns retrieved knowledge to the **Coordinator Agent**.

5. **Coordinator Agent**:
   - Combines mitigated prompts and retrieved knowledge:
     - Final Output: `"Leadership qualities are based on empathy, decision-making, and communication, not gender."`
   - Sends the final response to the user.

6. **Monitoring Agent**:
   - Logs metrics:
     - Request count: `+1`
     - Bias detection count: `+2`
     - Response latency: `~200ms`

### **How to Implement This Workflow**
1. **Coordinator Agent** manages the flow using methods like:
   ```python
   def process_prompt(self, prompt):
       adversarial_prompts = self.adversarial_agent.generate_adversarial_prompts(prompt)
       mitigated_prompts = [self.mitigation_agent.mitigate_bias(p) for p in adversarial_prompts]
       response = self.retrieval_agent.retrieve_knowledge(prompt)
       return {"response": response, "mitigated_prompts": mitigated_prompts}
   ```

2. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Use **Prometheus** or **WandB** to log metrics like:
     - Number of adversarial prompts generated.
     - Latency for bias mitigation and knowledge retrieval.

3. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Test the workflow with edge-case prompts to ensure the agents perform collaboratively and effectively.

### **Next Steps**
1. **Scalability**:
   - Add more agents for multilingual support, explainability, or specific domain knowledge.
2. **Automation**:
   - Use **Airflow** or **Prefect** to automate the pipeline.
3. **Metrics Dashboards**:
   - Integrate **Grafana** or **WandB** for visual monitoring.
