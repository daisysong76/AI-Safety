outline a cutting-edge Python project for Multi-Modal Preference Learning with Uncertainty Estimation, incorporating the key aspects you've described.  This project focuses on a modular design, allowing for experimentation and extension.

Project Title:  "Hermes" (Greek god of communication and boundaries, symbolizing multi-modal integration and uncertainty).

Core Components:
Multi-Modal Feature Extraction:
Text: Use transformer-based models like BERT, RoBERTa, or even more recent architectures like Gemini. Python libraries: transformers, torch.
Images: Leverage pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) like ResNet, EfficientNet, or Vision Transformers (ViT). Python libraries: torchvision, tensorflow, Pillow.
Structured Data: Use techniques like embedding lookup tables for categorical features and normalization/scaling for numerical features. Python libraries: pandas, scikit-learn.

Preference Learning Model:
Siamese Network: A common approach for preference learning. Two sets of multi-modal features (representing two items/options) are fed into the network. The network outputs a score representing the preference between the two. Python libraries: torch, tensorflow.
Ranking Loss: Use a ranking loss function (e.g., pairwise ranking loss, triplet loss) to train the model to correctly rank preferences.
Multi-Modal Fusion: Experiment with different fusion strategies:
Early Fusion: Concatenate features from all modalities before feeding them into the Siamese network.
Late Fusion: Train separate models for each modality and then combine their predictions.
Cross-Attention: Allow modalities to interact with each other using attention mechanisms.

Uncertainty Estimation:
Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs): Use BNNs to model the uncertainty in the model's predictions. Python libraries: torch, tensorflow (with extensions like tfp). This is a more advanced approach.
Ensemble Methods: Train an ensemble of models and use the variance in their predictions as a measure of uncertainty. Simpler to implement than BNNs.
Dropout as Uncertainty: Use dropout during both training and inference. The variance in predictions with different dropout masks can serve as a proxy for uncertainty.

Active Learning:
Uncertainty Sampling: Select the samples with the highest uncertainty (according to the chosen method) for human feedback.
Query-by-Committee: Maintain a committee of models and query the samples where the models disagree the most.
Adaptive Batch Selection: Select batches of samples that maximize information gain.

Handling Conflicting Preferences:
Preference Aggregation: Develop methods to aggregate preferences across modalities. For example, use weighted averaging or learn a meta-model to combine preferences.
Conflict Resolution: Implement strategies to handle conflicting preferences, such as prioritizing certain modalities or using human feedback to resolve conflicts.

Evaluation Framework:
Ranking Metrics: Use metrics like NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain), MAP (Mean Average Precision), and AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) to evaluate the model's ranking performance.
Preference Accuracy: Measure how well the model predicts human preferences.
Uncertainty Calibration: Evaluate how well the uncertainty estimates correlate with actual model errors.

Advanced Techniques (Optional):
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF): Use RLHF to fine-tune the model based on human feedback, improving its alignment with human preferences.
Generative Models for Preference Learning: Explore using generative models (e.g., GANs, diffusion models) to learn preference distributions.
